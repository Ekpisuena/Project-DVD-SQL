**ANALYZING DVD RENTAL DATABASE USING SQL** 

**Introduction**  

Every piece of information has a story to tell. Welcome to my DVD Rental Data Analysis project. 
As we deep dive into this database, we will discover relevant information about viewer preferences, 
watching patterns, and sales using SQL queries. Join me as we unlock the hidden stories by transforming 
raw data into meaningful narratives with the help of PostgresSQL.
